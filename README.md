# Dreamscape Atlas

## Project Overview

Dreamscape Atlas is a comprehensive web application specifically designed for **Dungeons & Dragons (D&D)** players, Dungeon Masters (DMs), and homebrew creators to build, organize, and explore their fictional worlds. Whether you're crafting a sprawling fantasy realm, a detailed campaign setting, or a collection of one-shot adventures, Dreamscape Atlas provides the tools to bring your D&D visions to life. It acts as a central repository for all your lore, characters, locations, timelines, magic items, and more, allowing for intricate connections and easy navigation within your created narratives and campaigns.

## Project Status

### ðŸš§ Work in Progress ðŸš§

This project is currently under active development and has not yet reached a working state. Key features are being implemented, and the application is subject to rapid changes.


## Key Features

-   **Hierarchical World Organization:** Structure your D&D world with interconnected articles for locations (cities, dungeons, wilderness), characters (NPCs, factions), organizations, magic items, spells, monsters, and more.

-   **Rich Text Editing:** Create detailed descriptions with rich text formatting, images, and embedded links, perfect for stat blocks, lore entries, and quest details.

-   **Relationship Mapping:** Define and visualize relationships between different elements of your world (e.g., character A is allied with faction B, location X is part of region Y, item Z is found in dungeon D).

-   **Timeline Management:** Build and manage chronological events within your campaign's history or a world's deep lore.

-   **Interactive Maps:** Upload and annotate campaign maps, regional maps, or dungeon layouts, linking points of interest directly to your lore articles.

-   **Private & Public Content:** Control the visibility of your world's elements, keeping campaign notes private or sharing finished lore with your players or the wider D&D community.

-   **Search & Navigation:** Easily find and navigate through your extensive D&D world data, making game prep and in-session lookups a breeze.
